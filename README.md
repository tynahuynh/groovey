# Playlist Generator - [Groovester](http://groove-with-me.herokuapp.com/)

An application that utilizes the Spotify API and user input to quickly generate a playlist of music by various artists. As an avid music listener and music festival attendee, I wanted to create a small application that can quickly create a playlist of songs by artists of my choice. This app is especially helpful when I am attending a festival where I am unfamilliar with the artists set to play. I would use groovester to familiarize myself with some of the artist's songs.
