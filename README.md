# Playlist Generator - [Groovester](http://groove-with-me.herokuapp.com/)

Groovester utilizes the Spotify API and user input to quickly generate a playlist of music by various artists. As an avid music listener and music festival attendee, I wanted to create a small application that can help me quickly create a playlist of songs by various artists. This app is especially helpful when I am attending a festival and want an easy way to familiarize myself with songs by unfamiliar artists.
